# Hamiltonian Solver and N-Body Simulation

This repository contains scripts for solving Hamiltonian systems and generating animations of celestial n-body simulations using Manim.

## File Descriptions

- **`manim_scripts/hamiltonian_solver.py`**
  - Implements the simulation of Hamiltonian systems using numerical methods.
  - Useful for analyzing systems with conserved quantities like energy.

- **`manim_scripts/celestial-n-body-simulation.py`**
  - Generates animations for celestial n-body simulations.
  - Leverages Manim for visualization of gravitational interactions between bodies.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12 (or later)
- Manim
- NumPy
- JAX
- Matplotlib
- tqdm

To install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install manim numpy jax matplotlib tqdm
```

## Notes

- Adjust parameters within each script to suit your specific simulation requirements.
- Refer to the [Manim documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/) for further customization of animations.
